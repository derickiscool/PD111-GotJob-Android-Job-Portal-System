# 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

## 2.5.1 Description
This section outlines specific technical limitations and mandatory design decisions that restrict the developer's implementation options. By defining strict boundaries like file size limits and specific validation logic, we ensure system stability and predictable data integrity.

## 2.5.2 Constraints
The following technical limitations must be enforced during the implementation of the system:

* **[SRS20]** The system shall restrict all uploaded files (such as CVs and resumes) to a maximum file size limit of 5MB. (Essential)
* **[SRS21]** The system shall enforce strict data integrity checks and input validation across all user submission forms. (Essential)

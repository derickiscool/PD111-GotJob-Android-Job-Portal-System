# Clarify Phase Methodology

## 1. Purpose & Objective
In the **Clarify** step, the team attempts to clarify on incongruent requirements that were flagged as ambiguous or incomplete during the Breakdown phase. 

The primary purpose is to **confirm the underlying business intent** and technical substance directly with the customer. This ensures that the subsequent "Interpret" phase is based on **agreed decisions** rather than vendor assumptions, reducing the risk of rework.

## 2. Approach & Methodology

### Engagement Approach
* **Stakeholder:** Project Manager (Uwais Hiring Agency).
* **Format:** Face-to-Face Meetings.
* **Focus:** High-priority incongruent requirements identified in the Breakdown Log.

### Methodologies Used
To bridge the gap between abstract requirements and practical application, the following methods were employed during sessions:

1.  **Scenario Walkthroughs:** We performed step-by-step walkthroughs of critical user flows (e.g., *Job Seeker Application* vs. *Recruiter Review*) to test how requirements would behave in realistic situations.

2.  **2D "Paper Napkin" Models:** To support shared understanding, we utilized low-fidelity "paper napkin" sketches. These visual aids were used to:
    * Make logic gaps visible instantly.
    * Visualize decision points in complex workflows.
    * Reach consensus on logic (e.g., matching algorithms) without the distraction of high-fidelity design details.

## 3. Directory Structure
The outputs of the clarification sessions are organized as follows:

| Folder/File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
|  **[meeting-summary.xlsx](./meeting-summary.xlsx)** | An Excel tracker logging all stakeholder meetings, including logistics (agenda, time, location, attendees) and detailed post-meeting notes/minutes. |
| **[model/](./model/)** | "Paper Napkin" Models used to provide visual aid during meetings. |


## 4. Next Steps
Once clarification is secured, these agreed-upon rules are passed to the **Interpret** phase, where they are rewritten into professional, testable requirement statements.
